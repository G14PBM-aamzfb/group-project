## Pattern formation by vascular mesenchymal cells

Paper: http://www.pnas.org/content/101/25/9247

First outline:

* Biology
  * context
  * explanation
  * relevance
  * relation between morphogen & cell growth (both math. and biol.)
  * Subsections
    1. morphogen
      * what is morphogen?
      * show some examples and give briefly explanation
      * why is it important?
      * how does it affect pattern formation?

    2. mesenchymal stem cell
      * what is msc? (some examples)
      * why is it important?
      * MSC applications in disease

    3. pattern formation
      * what is pattern formation?
      * what mechanisms in pattern formation? (few examples)

    4. reaction and diffusion system
      * what is this system?

* Model
  * explain model & parameters
  * stability analysis
  * explain predictions
  * difference between garfinkel mode and general reaction diffusion
  * talk about 3 variable model

* Simulation
  * recreate plots
  * implement 3 variable model
  * explain methods and simulation parameters

* conclusion
  * progress since 2004?
  * criticism and alternative?
  * figure out why simulation results differ
